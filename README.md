With this session, I propose to have a look at how we can make the world of Go match with the world of board games. In particular I wish to share the challenges and highlights of implementing a game of Ticket to Ride game in Go.

Since the basics concepts of Ticket to Ride are related to graphs, I will start by sharing some concepts about graphs, their relation to Ticket to Ride and how they can be implemented in Go.

Several Go features, like generics and interfaces, will be in the spotlight and show the simplicity that Go brings to tackle the complexity of the problem to solve.

To drive this point home I will go on to describe how to implement some examples of gameplay in its code structure and execution.

Programming games is fun and entertaining and, most importantly, a good playground for learning and practicing a language and as a Gopher I want to share how the simplicity of Go makes it easy to approach the creation of games (and eventually any kind of program) of a relatively high level of complexity.

Notes
This proposal comes from my passion about playing board games: it gave me the motivation to try implement one in Go and I thought about Ticket to Ride as it would have helped me also revising graph algorithms. I can taylor this session for a talk that last from 35 to 50 minutes and I plan to show the code in live and explain what specific features of Go made the game simple to create. I have already created a repository with the code that handles graphs algorithms and data structures in Go: https://github.com/mcaci/graphgo and Iâ€™m currently working on my free time on expanding it to have a playable simplified version of the Ticket to Ride board game.
